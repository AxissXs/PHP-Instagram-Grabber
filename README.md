# Get instagram images by hashtag!
A workaround for the new Instagram policy to get images by hashtag and user-id

```php
getImagesByHashtag("nofilter", 16);
```

```php
getImagesByUserID(12345, 16);
```

If something missing in the response, please open an issue to report :)

Help me build this better! Thanks! :)
